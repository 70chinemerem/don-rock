## Image Guidelines

1. **Format**: Use JPG or PNG format
2. **Optimization**: Compress images for web to ensure fast loading times
3. **Aspect Ratios**: 
   - Hero background: 16:9 or wider
   - Product images: 4:3 or 16:9
   - Company image: 3:2 or 16:9
4. **File Size**: Keep images under 500KB each for optimal performance
5. **Quality**: Use high-resolution images (at least 2x the display size for retina displays)

## Fallback Behavior

If images are not found, the website will:
- Show a gray background for product images
- Display the gradient background for the hero section
- The site will still function properly without images

## Adding Images

1. Place your image files in this directory (`src/assets/images/`)
2. Ensure filenames match exactly as listed above (case-sensitive)
3. The images will automatically appear on the website
